  Mock-mode fixtures for the Lark integration endpoints.

  Typed against the real contract on purpose: an untyped object literal lets a
  fixture silently fall behind the API it stands in for. That already happened —
  every flow response here was missing the required `generation`, which the
  Gateway uses to reject a superseded flow.
