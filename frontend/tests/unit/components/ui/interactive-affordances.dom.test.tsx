/*
  Three affordances that are easy to lose in a class string and that no other
  test looks at. Each one was a real defect until 2026-09-05:

  1. The dialog close button had no size class at all, so its hit area was
     exactly the 16px glyph — below the 24x24 minimum in WCAG 2.5.8.
  2. The switch had no `cursor-pointer`. Tailwind 4's preflight does not give
     buttons a pointer cursor, so it read as non-interactive under the mouse.
  3. The to-do panel's collapse control was a `<header>` with an onClick
     handler: unreachable by keyboard (WCAG 2.1.1) and silent about its state.

  These assert rendered attributes rather than the source string, so a
  refactor that keeps the behaviour keeps the tests.

    Both <Toaster /> call sites must go through `@/components/ui/sonner`, not

    defaults to "light", so toasts stayed light while the app was dark.
